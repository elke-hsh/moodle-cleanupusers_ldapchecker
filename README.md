# userstatus_ldapchecker
A subplugin for [https://github.com/learnweb/moodle-tool_cleanupusers](https://github.com/eLearning-TUDarmstadt/moodle-tool_cleanupusers) that uses data from an external server connected with LDAP.

Users that are no longer in the LDAP are archived by moving them to the DB table "mdl_tool_cleanupusers_archive". In the core table "mdl_user" the users will be anonymized: First name is set to "anonymous" and the user name to "anonymous+user-ID", e.g. "anonymous70". 
The "deletetime" setting defines how long users remain archived before they are finally deleted. If users return to the LDAP within this deletetime period, they are reactivated with all previous data from "mdl_user".

Settings located at /admin/settings.php?section=cleanupusers_userstatusldapchecker

cleanupusers_csv folder contains a reworked version of archive_user_task.php from tool_cleanupusers that saves users archived by the cron in a CSV file.
